# cardiovascular-disease-prediction
To start the project on cardiovascular disease prediction, we will follow the instructions and perform the necessary steps. Let's begin by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset.
Now that we have the dataset loaded, let's perform data preprocessing operations.
Next, we will perform data analysis and visualize the dataset to derive meaningful insights.
Now, let's train and evaluate various machine learning models on the dataset to find their accuracy levels.
Finally, we can build the machine learning model for heart disease detection based on the highest accuracy achieved.
Please note that the code provided assumes that you have a dataset named 'heart_disease_dataset.csv' available. Make sure to replace it with your actual dataset file name or provide the correct path to the dataset file.
Also, remember to preprocess and transform any new data you want to make predictions on using the same preprocessing steps applied to the training data.
